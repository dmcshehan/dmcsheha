#### Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

<p>I'm Shehan, a front-end web engineer based in the UAE ðŸ‡¦ðŸ‡ª. I absolutely love what I do because I get to take my ideas and bring them to life with beautiful interfaces. I'm a stickler for user experience, making sure the architecture is sound, and ensuring my code is top-notch.</p>

<p>I'm a fast learner and always up for trying out new technologies. I've got a good balance between being a perfectionist and being practical, which helps me get things done efficiently. I believe in working together as a team, following agile development methods, and writing clean code. I'm never satisfied with the status quo and I'm always looking for ways to improve. And if that means thinking outside the box, I'm all for it!</p>
